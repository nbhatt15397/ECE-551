In this waveform we can observe that,tx_data is x03
When rx_data fully receives all the bits, clr_rdy is asserted, rdy is asserted and the rx_data value, finally after counting up, reaches the value of x03.
After this we can observe the trmt signal is high, so the next data byte is ready to be transferred i.e. tx_data = x04, and so rx_data begins to 
receive the data and so we see the values in the rx_data waveform changing from the previously set x03 value to new bits that are being shifted into the 
receiver. Eventually, when all bits are received, rx_data = 04, and rdy and clr_rdy are set to 1.
