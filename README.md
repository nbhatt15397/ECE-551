# ECE-551
This repo comprises of all the verilog programs worked on during the Spring'20 semester.
The final project of the semester was to make a 5 channel Digital Logic Analyzer. Each channel has a VIH and VIL threshold so we
have the ability to detect if the logic signal in a given channel is mid range. The triggering logic is 
flexible and can be a function of edges or levels of the 5 input channels. It also allowed for protocol based
triggering (SPI & UART). The digital core stores each channel sample to its respective RAM bank.
